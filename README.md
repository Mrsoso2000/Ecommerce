# Argyle Co. - Jewellery Company

A fictional Jewellery company of my own named Argyle Co.:sparkles: that featured a wide range of finest jewelry from necklaces & pendants, rings, earrings, bracelets to fine watches. It aims to target customers and buyers that are facinated about any kind of jewelry.

Not to mention, the website spotlighted a multiple options bar on the top of the page that allow users to navigate specific categories or items desired without having difficulties scrolling down pages to look for products. As a result, provide users a better and friendly users experience when using the web. Additionally, a shopping cart icon located at the top-right corner of the page that shows a list of items that have been added by the customers and the total amount required to pay.

Last but not least, each and every customers is able to get a total of 10% discount for the first time shopping upon registering an account at Argyle.Co.

## Design Process

As mentioned earlier, the website target customers and users that are interested in finding any kind of jewellery. And the website featured a variety of categories of kind of jewellery that allows them to shop with convenient.

Before I came out with the idea of how the website should look like and the layout and color schemes, I gather information and identify how I can allow users to be more convenient in terms of saving time when using the website. Therefore, as a user myself I disvovered when navigating several websites it is challenging to look for things we are finding, resulting dealing with frustration and spending more time experiencing the website. So, I came out with the idea of implementing a multiple options bar for users to navigate those desired items that there are looking for.

Then, I start creating a wireframe for my website that showcases the layout of the website on how it should look like that gives me a clearer idea on how I should start progressing my project.

#### List of Users stories:

- As a shopaholic on jewellery, I wanted to search for a great amount of jewels, so that I can choose from a variety of choices.

3. [Javascript](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

4. [README File](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

5. [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/pricing/free-trial.html)

- The project uses Adobe XD to build prototype and brief idea of how the layout of the webpage should look like.

## Testing

**1. Search Bar :**

- i. Go to 'Seach Bar' located in the center-top of the page
- ii. Try and search for products that you are looking for and verify if it redirects to the pages related.
- iii. Try to type any irrelevant content inside the box and verify if there's any invalid input message appears.

So far, I'm having trouble aligning the contents in different screen sizes as it may look different from each. Therefore, I'm currently working on 'media queries' and 'flexboxes' to make the content align in its corrrect position on different screen sizes.

Moreover, users using browsers to navigate items in the home page may need to click to the 2nd page for viewing all products as the home page only consist 5-6 products while for phone view it will be showing up to 7-8 which is the desired amount of products I wanted to show at the home page.
