## Design Process

As mentioned earlier, the website target customers and users that are interested in finding any kind of jewellery. And the website featured a variety of categories of kind of jewellery that allows them to shop with convenient.

Before I came out with the idea of how the website should look like and the layout and color schemes, I gather information and identify how I can allow users to be more convenient in terms of saving time when using the website. Therefore, as a user myself I disvovered when navigating several websites it is challenging to look for things we are finding, resulting dealing with frustration and spending more time experiencing the website. So, I came out with the idea of implementing a multiple options bar for users to navigate those desired items that there are looking for.

Then, I start creating a wireframe for my website that showcases the layout of the website on how it should look like that gives me a clearer idea on how I should start progressing my project.
