11/11/2022 1.01AM So far im dealing with the porblem of search bar not aligning to the center of the web as the options selection's padding may overlay the search bar. Additionally, im trying to use '@keyframes' with animation to let the search bar shake when hover over. 

trying to find out what other animation adn effect to add for the options button when hover over.
